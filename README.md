# Console-Based Tic-Tac-Toe
## Overview:
This project is a console-based approach to a basic tic-tac-toe game. The game board will be displayed in the local terminal. Users may make plays using the keyboard.

Note: because this game is console-based, some behaviors may vary depending on the specific terminal. PyCharm's terminal, for example, will not work properly, or may display different colors than expected.

## How To Play:
- Execute ```python.exe tictactoe.py```
- Use the arrow keys to move
- Press the space bar to claim a box
